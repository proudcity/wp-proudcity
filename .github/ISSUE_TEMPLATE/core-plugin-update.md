## Notes

### Gravity Forms Stripe

- we [updated the plugin to handle connected account transfers](https://github.com/proudcity/gravityformsstripe/commit/10ed1155c74b7811e0b7b75bedb6f4fdfd42089e)
- [ ] check for [updates](https://docs.gravityforms.com/stripe-change-log/) above 5.9.1 as we're currently running a "hacked" version of it and need to update
- [ ] if updated check the [changes we made](https://github.com/proudcity/gravityformsstripe/commit/10ed1155c74b7811e0b7b75bedb6f4fdfd42089e) to see if anything needs to be updated to keep them or if we have a new hook

### Inuitive CPT caching

- check to see if [our PR](https://github.com/hijiriworld/intuitive-custom-post-order/pull/64) was accepted if not modify our plugin again

### Simple Staff List

- we [fixed magic vars](https://github.com/proudcity/simple-staff-list/commit/ac9f49753a87dd6952cc1f86068e1d236d9d15b6) which cause PHP errors
